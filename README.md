<h2><b></b>Overview:</b></h2>
<p>
  I am a self-taught developer, passionate about delivering software solutions that are simple and effective for end users. I have some formal education in IT Management, a bit of experience as a business analysts, and firey hot enthusiasm for delivering a product that ultimately serves to enhance the user experience. I am currently working on a few (full-stack) projects that showcase my abilities as an ASP.NET developer (see **Projects**).

<h2><b>Background:</b></h2>
<p> 
  I began my developer journey back in November 2022, spending the first few months self studying the fundamentals of C# and creating very simple applications. I made the conscious decision to stick with learning ASP.NET because I think it's practical to specialize in a particular framework first before branching out. Starting with the Console App, I learned the basics such as using methods and class objects. Worked on that for a bit and then moved to Winforms to get some experience with applying visualization to code. Then in January, I followed youtube tutorials that involve creating minimal CRUD applications using MVC. This gave me some broad experience connecting databases to endpoints. And so after a few months of getting familiar with the essentials, I decided to try my hand at developing a full stack application. This had by far been the biggest jump in challenge for me at the time and one that I was ambitious to take on. 
  
  Before getting started on the project, I had done much research in discovering some of the in-demand latest .NET technologies out there such as Blazor, EF Core, Razor Pages, etc. I ultimately decided to go with Blazor Server for my first big project because I felt intrigued by what Signal R has to offer. I also feel that the Blazor framework is Microsoft's flagship product and one that they're putting a lot of attention towards. Even though MVC is still predominant in the workplace, it seems that Blazor is the next big thing to get onboard with. In short, the full stack project was great experience. I felt that my programming knowledge increased substantially because of it. But my goals don't stop there. I plan to develop more projects in the next several months. I will continue to improve my skills as a developer and work towards landing my first gig at a junior level .NET position.
  
  Much of my focus going foward will be centered on Blazor in .NET 8 and then potentially MAUI or Xamarin. But regardless of whatever technology the requirements dictate, I ultimately strive to make sure that the application I build is a product that puts user experience first.
